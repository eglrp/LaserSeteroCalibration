version 1.1
(11/10/2006) : Linux bug fix
- Apparently the 'uigetfile' function sometimes does not work
correctly on linux (search for 'uigetfile linux bug' for details). It
is currently fixed by forcing Matlab to not use native system dialogs,
and the appropriate instruction has been added to the
select_calibfile_fn callback.
- Documentation has been updated with a (hopefully) better
explanation of the math through an added appendix.

(03/01/2006) : backward compatibility
- Set MAT file preferences to support Matlab v6 compatiblity. This
will make the fig files larger as v7 uses some sort of compression
scheme.
- Some of the fig files seemed corrupted and unreadable in Matlab on
windows. Checking them with matcat.m seems to fix the problem. I added
a script check_fig_files to look at each of them and print out status
messages.

version 1.0 - the "inaugral release"
